Hi, this is Yichong from China, or you can call me my English name, Sabrina.
I am a senior student at Wuhan University and my major is Statistics now. I plan to continue my graduate study in America, and I am very pleased that I have been admitted to Duke University! Duke University is my dream school. I feel so lucky that I have been offered such a precious opportunity.
